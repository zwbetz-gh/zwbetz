intro: Hello.

<p>
  My name is Zachary Betz and I'm a software developer by trade. I currently work at <a href="https://www.hln.com/">HLN</a>, where I have the pleasure
  of doing full-stack web development with a small, nimble team.
</p>

<p>
  Here's my <a href="/resume/">resume</a>. Find me on GitHub at
  <a href="https://github.com/zach-betz-hln">zach-betz-hln</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zwbetz-gh">zwbetz-gh</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of work and raising our kids, I enjoy hanging with family and friends, walks, good food, films, and taking
  things slow.
