intro: Hey there.

<p>My name is Zachary Betz and I'm a software developer by trade.</p>

<p>
  I have the pleasure of doing full-stack web development with a small
  <a href="https://www.hln.com/">team</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Find me on GitHub at
  <a href="https://github.com/zach-betz-hln">zach-betz-hln</a> (by day) and <a
    href="https://github.com/zwbetz-gh">zwbetz-gh</a> (tinkering in spare moments).
</p>

<p>Husband. Father. I enjoy good talks and long walks, good food and film, and taking things slow.</p>
