Welcome to my corner of the internet. Come on in and make yourself at home. `zwbetz` is short for my full name, Zachary Wade Betz. I'm a husband, father, and generally curious person.

My [Blog]({{< relref "blog" >}}) is a loose collection of thoughts, things learned, and who-knows-whats. I maintain a few [Projects]({{< relref "projects" >}}). This site also has a [RSS feed](index.xml).

**Work.** I'm a Software Engineer at [Sev1Tech](https://sev1tech.com) (formerly [Geocent](https://geocent.com)). Here's my resume in [HTML](/resume/resume.html) and [JSON](/resume/resume.json).

**Education.** I have a B.S. in Information Systems and Decision Sciences from [LSU](https://www.lsu.edu).

**Contact.** Wanna get in touch? Email me at `zwbetz` `@` `gmail.com`. Find me elsewhere on [GitHub](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh).

**Various.** Some blog oldies: [Simple Pleasures]({{< relref "simple-pleasures" >}}) and [Things I Like]({{< relref "things-i-like" >}}).

A quote by one of my favorite thinkers, Carl Jung.

> Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.
