My buddy Texas sent me this song by INZO. The first time I listened to it I got full body chills. The lyrics hit home. After a few listens, I was curious about the origin story. Turns out it's a sample of [Alan Watts](https://alanwatts.org/).

## Lyrics

> A person who thinks all the time \
> Has nothing to think about except thoughts \
> So, he loses touch with reality \
> And lives in a world of illusions \

> By thoughts, I mean specifically, chatter in the skull \
> Perpetual and compulsive repetition of words \
> Of reckoning and calculating \
> I'm not saying that thinking is bad \
> Like everything else, it's useful in moderation \
> A good servant, but a bad master \

> That's to say \
> We confuse signs \
> With the real world \

> This is the beginning of meditation \
> \
> Most of us would have \
> Rather money than tangible wealth \
> And a great occasion is somehow spoiled for us unless photographed \
> And to read about it the next day in the newspaper \
> Is oddly more fun for us than the original event \
> \
> This is a disaster \
> For as a result of confusing the real world of nature with mere signs \
> We are destroying nature \
> We are so tied up in our minds that we've lost our senses \
> \
> Time to wake up \
> What is reality? \
> Obviously no one can say \
> Because it isn't words \
> It isn't material, that's just an idea \
> \
> Reality is \
> \
> ...
