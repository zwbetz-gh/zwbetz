This recipe is an amalgamation of a few things: My dad had made some Crazy Johnnie's BBQ shrimp for a family event. Once I peeled the leftovers, I couldn't bring myself to throw away the juice because it smelled so good. My wife suggested making a chicken and sausage gumbo and adding the juice in. I had never made gumbo before, but my sister-in-law makes a good one. Between her recipe, and [Cajun Ninja's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqUOBaSVHZE) recipe, this one was born.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Instant Roux Mix (Tony Chachere's)
- 1 onion
- 1 green bell pepper
- 3 sticks celery
- 2 lbs smoked sausage
- 4 lbs chicken thighs
- 2 32 oz containers chicken stock
- 4 cups water
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 3 bay leaves
- 5 oz Heinz 57 Sauce
- 1/4 cup Louisiana Fish Fry Crawfish Shrimp & Crab Boil
- BBQ seasoning to taste

## Directions

1. Do prep: Chop vegetables finely (or use food processor) and put aside. Slice sausage thinly and put aside
1. Brown sausage then put aside
1. Make roux the hard way, or use Instant Roux Mix (I bet you can't taste the difference in the end result)
1. Once roux is ready, add vegetables, then cook for about 10 minutes to soften them
1. Add rest of ingredients, bring to a boil, then turn heat to low for about 1 hour
