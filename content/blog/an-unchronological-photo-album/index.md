- Fresh out of the baby oven
- Sleepy time
- Holding Tigtig, his stuffed Tiger from Winnie-the-Pooh
- Grabbing nature by the horns, in the form of frogs, lizards, grasshoppers
- Hangin' with grandparents
- Mud, as in dirt and water used to their fullest
- Stuffing his face -- quite hilarious how many photos we have of him eating, he gets that honest from mom and dad
- Travel, for when Townes takes on the world
